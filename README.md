# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
Worldwide nations strive to improve the life expectancy and understanding the cause of death will be a critical tool to improve human health and living standards. I was trying to understand the available data and create insights about the reason behind the mortality. By pursuing these approaches and constantly updating the quality of data, we can enhance our understanding of the causes of death worldwide. This understanding, in turn, can guide the development and implementation of effective interventions, policies, and healthcare strategies to reduce mortality and improve global health outcomes. 

In this project, I have tried to present and visualize the available data which makes the end user ( Health Care providers and policy makers) to easily analyze and make relevant decisions for improving the overall living standards.    


## Process
Step 1 – Downloaded the data from online and converted the CSV file to Excel for gaining initial understanding and performing basic cleaning on the data. In this process, I got an overview of the available data but considering the scale of data, It was difficult to get some insights.  
Step 2 – Imported the files into Tableau and created some relations with the column and data available before opening the sheet and start doing the analysis.   
Step 3 – Stared doing analysis and created relevant charts for analysis in different sheets based on visualisation of the given data.  
Step 4 -  Created a dashboard with map view taking the lead and the rest of the graphs will change based on the country chosen. The Dashboard has the overview of both the geographical distribution and the ability to get more details on factors affecting the life expectancy by choosing the filters and country.
Step 5 - Created a story for the purpose of presenting it to the audience. 


## Results
I started the analysis by understand the factors causing death. Since the number of factors is large, I decided to form a tree chart which is capable of handling large variables and showing good comparison along with clear labels to understand the major cause.     
Created a Map to understand the worldwide distribution of the factors affecting human life and it was naturally proportional to the population density. The map had an interactive filter to find distribution of every disease and this gives more option to explore the data and understand the pattern. Few examples are, the viral disease is major cause for death in low income countries where vaccination is less and death due to alcohol is prevalent in developed nations. 
Created animations on time series to track the progress of each factor over the time and the bar graph also featured the share of country in different colour stacked within the disease bar graph. The animation with respect to years is visually good to understand the progress. 
Created a forecast to predict the possible population affected by different factors for the next three years using analytics 
Created a dashboard with map view playing as a main filter and the rest of the graphs will change based on the country chosen. The Dashboard has the overview of both the geographical distribution and the ability to get more details on factors affecting the life expectancy by choosing the filters. 

## Challenges 
The data primarily had details of the disease, number of deaths and country. This is a good data to start but it would have been better if more details of the people like age, sex, occupation, habits, food, income etc.. are provided. This would have given more opportunity to make good insights and multiple options to explore.    
## Future Goals
If given more time I would have tried to work include parameter, sets and created more fields relevant to the analysis. I would also like to get more open source details like country population, vaccination rate, Income, age group etc..  to get more insights.
